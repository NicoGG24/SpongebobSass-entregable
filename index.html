                    <p>The movie begins with a live-action sequence of a pirate crew finding tickets to The SpongeBob
                        SquarePants Movie and sailing to the movie theater to watch the film.

                        In the movie proper, SpongeBob prepares for the opening ceremony of the Krusty Krab 2 (located
                        next
                        to
                        the original Krusty Krab), believing that his boss Mr. Krabs will promote him as manager of the
                        new
                        restaurant. At the ceremony, the title is instead given to his co-worker Squidward Tentacles.
                        Krabs
                        says
                        that Squidward is more mature and that SpongeBob is "just a kid" who is unable to handle the
                        task,
                        upsetting SpongeBob.

                        Meanwhile, Plankton laments over his futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula
                        and
                        take
                        over the world, until his computer wife Karen reminds him of "Plan Z". At night, Plankton
                        carries
                        out
                        the plan by stealing King Neptune's crown and sending it to Shell City, leaving false evidence
                        behind to
                        frame Krabs for the crime. That same night, SpongeBob heads to his favorite restaurant, Goofy
                        Goober's,
                        where he drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend Patrick Star, and wakes up the
                        next
                        morning with a hangover. King Neptune goes to the Krusty Krab 2 to confront Krabs about his
                        stolen
                        crown. The still-hungover SpongeBob also arrives and bad-mouths Krabs, but upon seeing that his
                        boss's
                        life is at risk, promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune is
                        convinced
                        by his daughter Mindy to give SpongeBob a chance; he freezes Krabs and orders SpongeBob to
                        return
                        with
                        the crown within six days in order to spare Krabs's life. Mindy warns SpongeBob and Patrick of
                        the
                        dangers of Shell City, including "the Cyclops", who captures innocent sea creatures who are
                        never to
                        be
                        seen again. SpongeBob and Patrick head off for Shell City in the Patty Wagon - a Krabby
                        Patty-shaped
                        car
                        stored underneath the Krusty Krab.

                    <p>Back in Bikini Bottom, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula and uses it to sell Krabby
                        Patties at
                        his restaurant, the Chum Bucket, claiming Krabs willed the recipe to him. When Karen informs him
                        that
                        SpongeBob and Patrick are attempting to reclaim Neptune's crown, Plankton reveals he has hired a
                        hitman
                        named Dennis to eliminate the duo. Squidward discovers the truth about Plankton stealing
                        Neptune's
                        crown
                        and goes to the Chum Bucket to confront him. Before Squidward can leave and alert Neptune,
                        Plankton
                        activates his mind-controlling souvenir bucket helmets to enslave the residents of Bikini
                        Bottom,
                        seizing Squidward as well. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick come across a hazardous trench and
                        lose
                        the
                        Patty Wagon. About to give up, Mindy appears and gives them encouragement by using her "mermaid
                        magic"
                        to bestow seaweed mustaches on them, convincing them that they have matured from boys into men
                        and
                        they
                        successfully pass the trench.

                        SpongeBob and Patrick meet Dennis who tries to step on them with his giant boot, but he gets
                        stomped
                        on
                        by a larger boot - which belongs to the previously mentioned Cyclops (a diver). The Cyclops
                        captures
                        SpongeBob and Patrick and takes them to his store by the beach where dead, dried sea creatures
                        are
                        sold
                        as souvenirs, which is in fact "Shell City" itself. SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown, but
                        the
                        Cyclops' heat lamp dries them. However, they shed tears just before their temporary demise that
                        short-circuits the lamp, which releases smoke and activates the emergency sprinkler system,
                        reviving
                        them, as well as the other dried-out sea creatures being sold as souvenirs. While the vengeful
                        sea
                        creatures attack the Cyclops, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head out to the beach.
                        After
                        accidentally losing their way home, David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride. On the way,
                        Dennis
                        catches up to them, but gets knocked off Hasselhoff's back into the sea when he passes
                        underneath a
                        catamaran.

                        Back at the Krusty Krab 2, Neptune arrives to execute Krabs when SpongeBob and Patrick return
                        with
                        the
                        crown with Hasselhoff's help and save Krabs. However, Plankton drops a mind-control bucket on
                        Neptune
                        and surrounds SpongeBob, Patrick and Mindy with his army of slaves. SpongeBob, embracing the
                        fact
                        that
                        he's accomplished so much despite being a kid, uses the power of rock and roll to play "Goofy
                        Goober
                        Rock" (a parody of Twisted Sister's "I Wanna Rock"), and frees Neptune and the citizens of
                        Bikini
                        Bottom
                        from the helmets with his magic guitar. Plankton tries to escape, but is squashed flat when a
                        horde
                        of
                        citizens arrive at the Krusty Krab 2 and rush in to greet the one who liberated them. Plankton
                        is
                        then
                        arrested by the police and King Neptune thanks SpongeBob for his bravery and unfreezes Krabs
                        (only
                        to
                        accidentally turn him into a real human boy before actually reverting him to his normal self),
                        who
                        graciously gives the title of general manager of the Krusty Krab 2 to him.
