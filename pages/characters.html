                        <h2>Spongebob</h2>
                        <p>
                            SpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic sea sponge. In The SpongeBob
                            Musical, his exact species of animal is identified: Aplysina fistularis, a yellow tube
                            sponge that is common in open waters. He resides in the undersea city of Bikini
                            Bottom with other anthropomorphic aquatic creatures. He works as a fry cook at a local
                            fast food restaurant, the Krusty Krab, to which he is obsessively attached, showing
                            devotion to it above other restaurants. His boss is Eugene Krabs, a greedy crab who
                            nonetheless treats SpongeBob like a son. Squidward Tentacles, an octopus, and
                            SpongeBob's ill-tempered, snobbish neighbor, works as the restaurant's cashier.
                            SpongeBob's hobbies include fishing for jellyfish, practicing karate with his friend
                            Sandy Cheeks (a squirrel from Texas), and blowing bubbles.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            SpongeBob is often seen hanging around with his best friend, starfish Patrick Star, one
                            of his neighbors. SpongeBob lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail, Gary. His
                            unlimited optimistic cheer often leads him to perceive the outcome of numerous endeavors
                            and the personalities of those around him as happier than they really are. He believes,
                            for instance, that Squidward Tentacles enjoys his company even though he clearly harbors
                            an intense dislike for him (though they have been shown to get along on rare
                            occasions). SpongeBob's greatest goal in life is to obtain his driver's license from
                            Mrs. Puff's boating school, but he often panics and crashes when driving a boat.

                            Patrick is the ignorant but humorous best friend of SpongeBob SquarePants. He is portrayed
                            as being an overweight pink starfish, who serves as the village idiot of the underwater city
                            of Bikini Bottom. Patrick gets dumber throughout the series and has been shown to make
                            many ludicrous mistakes. Despite this, he has occasionally been portrayed as a savant, with
                            articulate observance to certain subjects in specific detail. However, he always reverts
                            quickly back to his usual, unintelligent self after displaying a moment of wisdom. He
                            holds no form of occupation except for several very brief stints working at the Krusty Krab
                            and at the Chum Bucket in a variety of positions, and mostly spends his time either
                            clowning around with SpongeBob, catching jellyfish with him, or lounging beneath the rock
                            under which he resides.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            At home, Patrick is usually depicted either sleeping, watching TV, or engaged in the "art of
                            doing nothing", at which he is an expert. All the furnishings in the space under his rock
                            are made of sand, and Patrick can simply opt to quickly build up furniture as needed; even
                            so, his living space is sparse and contains only the barest essentials. Aside from his
                            best friend SpongeBob, who is often impressed by Patrick's capacity to come up with na√Øve
                            yet genius plans or solutions, Patrick frequently irritates those around him and is
                            confounded by the simplest of questions or subjects. The characters of Mr. Krabs and
                            Squidward have no patience for Patrick's stupidity, and the former does not pay him much
                            regard; Clancy Brown, who provides Mr. Krabs' voice, said, "The only person that he [Mr.
                            Krabs] doesn't hire is Patrick because Patrick is just too stupid to work for nothing."
                            Sandy often gets annoyed by Patrick, but still sees him as a friend.

                            Squidward is depicted as a grumpy and bitter turquoise octopus. He lives in the underwater
                            city of Bikini Bottom in a moai situated between SpongeBob SquarePants' pineapple house and
                            Patrick Star's rock. Squidward is annoyed by his neighbors for their perpetual laughter
                            and boisterous behavior, though SpongeBob and Patrick are oblivious to being a nuisance to
                            Squidward.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Squidward lives in a constant state of self-pity and misery; he is unhappy with his humdrum
                            lifestyle and yearns for celebrity status, wealth, hair, and a glamorous and distinguished
                            career as a musician or painter with a passion for art and playing the clarinet, although he
                            has no actual talent for either. However, he is left to endure the lowly status as a
                            fast-food cashier at the Krusty Krab restaurant. Squidward resents his job and is irritated
                            by his greedy employer Mr. Krabs and by having his own resented neighbor SpongeBob as a
                            colleague.

                            Mr. Krabs is commonly known as the greedy founder and owner of the Krusty Krab
                            restaurant, where SpongeBob works as a fry cook and Squidward works as a cashier. The
                            restaurant's success is built on little competition and the popularity of the Krusty Krab's
                            signature sandwich, the Krabby Patty, the formula to which is a closely guarded trade
                            secret. Mr. Krabs frequently exploits his restaurant's popularity, engaging in price
                            gouging and charging his own employees for use of the building's services.
                            <br>

                            Krabs' rival and former best friend Plankton operates the Chum Bucket, an unsuccessful
                            restaurant across the street from the Krusty Krab. A major plot point throughout the
                            series is Plankton failing to steal the Krabby Patty formula with the help of his computer
                            wife, Karen, under the assumption that they would be able to replicate the burgers and put
                            the Krusty Krab out of business. To avoid this, Krabs goes to extreme lengths to prevent
                            Plankton from obtaining the recipe; he even refuses to allow him to buy a Krabby Patty
                            legitimately out of fear that Plankton might use Karen to reverse-engineer the formula.
                            Krabs also makes it his duty to ensure that the Chum Bucket never has any business
                            whatsoever.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Krabs values money more than his own well-being and assesses the other characters based on
                            their financial value to him. The only exceptions are Pearl and his girlfriend Mrs.
                            Puff. His love for Mrs. Puff is so strong that it temporarily transcends his greed and
                            drives him to buy her expensive gifts. Krabs tolerates his two employees because they
                            work for little pay and because of their positive impact on his finances, but he is quick to
                            rebuke them if they engage in behavior that drives away customers. Krabs has a tentative
                            father-son relationship with SpongeBob; Krabs often scolds him if he gets in trouble, but at
                            times gives him fatherlike advice. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt has stated that this
                            Krabs-SpongeBob dynamic is his favorite part of the show, telling Digital Spy in 2011 that
                            "the aspect of SpongeBob I love the most is his undying loyalty to Mr. Krabs. No matter how
                            Mr. Krabs treats him. I try to replicate that in my own life in every way."

                            Plankton is the nemesis and former best friend of Mr. Krabs. He is the owner of the Chum
                            Bucket, a fast food restaurant located directly across the street from Krabs' restaurant,
                            the Krusty Krab. The Chum Bucket primarily sells chum (bait consisting of fish parts),
                            which is considered mostly inedible by the other characters. As a result, his restaurant is
                            a commercial failure. Plankton's primary goal in the series is to steal the Krabby Patty
                            Secret Formula so he can sell Krabby Patties at the Chum Bucket. His villainous efforts to
                            do this are widely known within the show; fellow character Squidward Tentacles refers to
                            Plankton as "the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom".
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A running gag throughout the series is the fact that Plankton is smaller than the other
                            regular characters; he is easily stepped on and sent flying back to the Chum Bucket with a
                            mere flick of the finger. His small size has led him to develop a Napoleon complex,
                            which is occasionally manifested as a desire for global domination. He is a skillful
                            inventor and regularly builds machines, both to help him in his plots, and for his own
                            personal gain. Although he uses his intellect for evil, Plankton did not start out as a
                            villainous scientist; he built Karen, his first invention, when he was friends with Mr.
                            Krabs in grade school. Prominent in his earliest appearances, Plankton's catchphrase is
                            "I went to college!" He also has a pet amoeba named Spot who at first was a guard dog,
                            but later became a retriever.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Plankton's roles are not exclusively antagonistic. Outside of business, he seems to have a
                            somewhat friendly relationship with SpongeBob. In The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water,
                            Plankton allies himself with SpongeBob, initially to protect himself from an angry mob, but
                            gradually warms up to SpongeBob throughout the movie. The movie has been described by The
                            Guardian as a "buddy film" between Plankton and SpongeBob. Series creator Stephen
                            Hillenburg considered Plankton to be "more of a caricature of a villain" than a truly evil
                            character.
