                    <p class="darkBackground">The Krusty Krab is a prominent fast food restaurant in the underwater city
                        of Bikini Bottom. It
                        is owned and operated by Eugene H. Krabs (Mr. Krabs), who invented its famous Krabby Patty
                        sandwich. Krabs plans to transfer ownership of the restaurant to his daughter, Pearl, when
                        she is older. Squidward Tentacles and SpongeBob SquarePants work at the Krusty Krab as the
                        cashier and fry cook, respectively. The other main characters of the series have also held
                        temporary, single-episode positions at the Krusty Krab.

                        Located across the street from the Krusty Krab is the Chum Bucket, another fast food restaurant
                        owned and operated by Plankton and Karen. Plankton, Mr. Krabs' former best friend,[3] later
                        became his arch-competitor; Plankton's futile attempts at stealing the secret Krabby Patty
                        recipe to replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business is a major plot point
                        throughout the series.
                        <br>

                        The Krusty Krab usually attracts customers from Bikini Bottom because of the Krabby Patty's
                        renowned taste and the fact that Plankton's restaurant has a menu consisting of chum (bait
                        consisting of fish parts), which is considered mostly inedible by the other characters. As a
                        result, the Krusty Krab has become one of the most successful restaurants in the city. In the
                        show, SpongeBob calls it "the finest eating establishment ever established for eating". Mr.
                        Krabs frequently exploits his restaurant's popularity, such as engaging in price gouging and
                        charging his own employees for use of the building's services.

                        In the season 3 episode "Krusty Krab Training Video", the Krusty Krab building is shown to have
                        originally been a run-down retirement home called the Rusty Krab, which Mr. Krabs acquired and
                        converted into a restaurant. In another episode, the restaurant was also the name of a pirate
                        ship owned by Mr. Krabs before he started the business. The restaurant has seen a lot of
                        temporary changes throughout the show, such as operating 24/7 and being transformed into a
                        hotel, which have been the focus of many episodes. Other episodes have depicted the Krusty Krab
                        being damaged or destroyed.

                    <p class="darkBackground">Krabby Patties make their debut appearance in SpongeBob SquarePants' pilot
                        episode "Help Wanted"
                        and have had many different variations throughout the show's run.

                        The Krabby Patty burger is a menu item sold by the Krusty Krab as a fast food product. It is
                        considered to be one of the most successful foods in Bikini Bottom. The Krabby Patty formula
                        is a closely guarded trade secret, and rival restaurateur Plankton's futile attempts at
                        acquiring the secret formula is a major recurring theme throughout the series. The Krusty Krab
                        usually attracts customers from Bikini Bottom because of the Krabby Patty's renowned taste and
                        the fact that Plankton's restaurant, the Chum Bucket, has a menu consisting of mostly inedible
                        chum. Due to the lack of viable competition, Mr. Krabs is generally free to engage in price
                        gouging, a practice he has been known to do throughout the show. Sometimes the Krusty Krab is
                        shown to have a drive-thru to serve krabby patties seen in the episodes "Driven to Tears" and
                        "Drive Thru" as well as The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water. It is noted by Mr. Krabs
                        that the Krusty Krab and the Krabby Patty is clean and disease-free.
